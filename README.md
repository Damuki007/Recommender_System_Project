## Stream254:
Enhance Your Movie Watching Experience with Uncharted Cinematic Treasures
## Introduction
The rapid development of data collection has heralded a new era of information. Data is being used to create more efficient systems, which is where Recommendation Systems come into play. Recommendation Systems are a sort of information filtering system that improves search results by displaying items that are more relevant to the search query or to the user's search history.

They estimate a user's rating or preference for an item. Almost every major internet company has utilized them in some form or another: Amazon uses them to recommend products to customers, YouTube uses them to choose which video to play next on autoplay.

## Documentation

 Dataset from (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/)

  We used the "small" dataset containing 100,000 user ratings

## Business Problem
Stream254 recognizes that traditional one-size-fits-all approaches to content delivery are no longer sufficient to meet the evolving demands of Kenyan viewers. Without personalized recommendations, users may face decision fatigue and frustration when navigating the platform's extensive content library. In a highly competitive market, failure to engage users effectively could lead to decreased retention rates and loss of market share.

To address this challenge, Stream254 seeks to implement a recommendation system that leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and deliver highly relevant movie recommendations. By doing so, Stream254 aims to enhance user satisfaction, drive long-term engagement, and establish itself as a leader in the Kenyan streaming space.
## Business Objectives
Develop and implement state-of-the-art recommendation algorithm that will analyze user behaviour, preferences, and viewing patterns to generate personalized movie recommendations with the intention to:

   1. Enhance User Satisfaction: By providing users with tailored movie recommendations, we aim to enhance user satisfaction and deliver an immersive viewing experience that keeps users coming back for more.

   2. Increase User Retention: Through personalized recommendations, we seek to increase user retention rates and encourage users to spend more time on the platform, ultimately driving revenue growth and profitability.

   3. Establish Competitive Differentiation: By offering a recommendation system that surpasses those of competitors, we aim to differentiate Stream254 as the go-to destination for personalized entertainment experiences in the Kenyan market.

   4. Implement Performance Metrics: We will implement robust metrics and analytics to measure the performance of the recommendation system. This will enable us to continuously optimize algorithms and enhance user engagement over time.
