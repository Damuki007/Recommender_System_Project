    "Stream254 recognizes that traditional one-size-fits-all approaches to content delivery are no longer sufficient to meet the evolving demands of Kenyan viewers. Without personalized recommendations, users may face decision fatigue and frustration when navigating the platform's extensive content library. In a highly competitive market, failure to engage users effectively could lead to decreased retention rates and loss of market share.\n",
